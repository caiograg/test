One piece of text here.


Add something here. I'm starting a new feature!
Now, working on more stuff. This is the philosofical part... I'm thinking a little about it.
I'll commit every single change so I save my work.

I am another user. Just FORKED the project and am commiting to my personal copy of the project.
The changes I made here where added directly to a second branch in my fork.
Now I merged it into the main (this is mr-cg:main not caiograg:main).
Added this directly to main (OMG!).
